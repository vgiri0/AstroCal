JHora 4.5.0
=================
Python package containing almost all the features described in the book

`Vedic Astrology - An Integrated Approach - by PVR Narasimha Rao`
![Vedic Astrology - An Integrated Approach by PVR Narasimha Rao](./src/jhora/images/pvr_ebook.jpg)

and 

the free astrology software `Jagannatha Hora V8.0 software` by the same author.


 ![Jagannatha Hora V8.0 software](./src/jhora/images/jhora_pvr.jpg)

This python library was inspired by his book and software. Almost all the results have been verified against the examples and exercises provided in the book. Also the features that are outside of his book but in his JHora software were collected from various internet sources and have been verified closest to results obtained using JHora software. 

There is a test module (`jhora.tests.pvr_tests`) containing about 6300 tests that can be run to verify the same. Please note the tests assume `const._DEFAULT_AYANAMSA_MODE='LAHIRI'`.

Having said that, if you find this package useful, all the credits go to Shri. P.V.R Narasimha Rao for such a wonderful book and the software and to the other internet sources.

Installation Requirements
-------------------------
This package is available in pypi.org

`pip install PyJHora`

IMPORTANT: From 3.6.6 onwards due to space limitations, the installation wheel/tar file will not contain the ephemeris data files. They should be copied from previous versions or directly from
`https://github.com/naturalstupid/pyjhora/src/jhora/data/ephe` folder 
Copy all the files from that folder to package installation directory `jhora/data/ephe`

Requirements
-------------

Python interface to Swiss ephemeris and Qt.

```
	pip install pyswisseph	# OR apt-get install pyswisseph
	pip install pyqt6       # OR apt-get install pyqt6
```
There are other dependencies listed in the file `requirements.txt` should be installed using `pip` if not already available.
There are four basic UI files namely: `panchangam.py`, `vedic_calendar.py`, `horo_chart_tabs.py` and `match_ui.py`.
`panchangam.py` - provides a one page panchanga information. `vedic_calendar.py` provides calendar for current month. 
`horo_chart_tabs.py`- provides multi-tab/page panchanga, divisional charts and `match_ui.py` - provides marriage compatibility between boy and girl based on their birh stars.

```
Changes since 4.4.5
===================
Updated `tithi(jd,place)` to return adhik tithi of the day if it exists.

Updated Shadbala calculations to fix the errors. Now the results match the calculations of VP Jain and BV Raman examples in their respective books. However, it is important to note, shadbala calculations does not match with JHora (even for these examples). Added tests to VP Jain/ BV Raman book examples.

Fixed encoding error in `utils.py`

Added special tithis to Panchangam page.

Changes since 4.4.0
===================
Fixed errors in resource lists of Telugu, Kannada and Hindi

Added `lunar_month_date(jd, place,use_purnimanta_system=False)`. This function can provide lunar month with Amantha and Purnimantha systems. Vedic Calendar Widget updated to support these systems.

Added Malayalam language.

To load world cities, earlier versions used Pandas but users have said, it consumed 25+GB memory. From this version onwards, csv is used to read and write the world cities data. Performance has improved.

Added `drik.next_lunar_month`, `drik.next_lunar_year`, `drik.previous_lunar_month` and `drik.previous_lunar_year` functions.
`drik.raasi(jd,place)` end time return value changed from string to float hours
`drik.lunar_month_date` revised to return in addition lunar year index as last argument

Added `drik.vedic_date(jd,place,calendar_type)` to get solar/lunar month/day/year

Changes since 4.3.5
===================
Refactored `utils` by removing global variables replaced with `setattr`

Added Vedic Calendar Widget

More ways of calculating `tamil_month_and_date` added. Default can be chosen from `const.tamil_month_method`


Changes since 4.3.1
===================
Added `pushkara_yoga(jd, place)`, `aadal_yoga(jd, place)`, `vidaal_yoga(jd, place)`, `disha_shool(jd)` and `yogini_vaasa(jd,place)` features.

Added Vedic Clock feature (both VedicDigitalClock and VedicAnalogClock)

Added an option to `show_vedic_clock` option to `jhora.ui.panchangam.Panchanga` class. The class default is False but if panchangam.py is executed it is initiated with True.

Changes since 4.2.5
====================
Due to error in Karana calculations, revised `jhora.panchanga.drik.karana` function. Till V4.2.5, karana was working for one half of tithis.

Added chandrashtama, karaka yoga/tithi, nava/special thaara, fraction_moon_yet_to_traverse and next panchaka days features.

Rewritten `jhora.panchanga.drik` functions `nakshatra(jd,place)`, `tithi(jd,place`, `yogam(jd,place` functions (they are now calculated using Moon/Sun/Planet speeds). `tithi` and `yogam` also now support using planets other than Moon and Sun for calculating tithi or yogam. Prior methods using Inverse Lagrange are left with `_old` suffixes. One can switch to using inverse lagrange by setting `const.use_planet_speed_for_panchangam_end_timings=False`

`yogam(jd,place,tithi_index=1,planet1=const._MOON,planet2=const._SUN,cycle=1)`
`tithi(jd,place,tithi_index=1,planet1=const._MOON,planet2=const._SUN,cycle=1)`
tithi_index can be 1 to 12 (for Janma tithi to Vyaya tithi) and cycle can be 1 to 3. Please note Cycle=1 to 3 results do not match with JHora. To support this changes made to `vratha.py`, `main.py` and the UI code.

New Lambda functions `daily_moon_speed`, `daily_sun_speed` and `daily_planet_speed` added to `drik.py`

`_panchanga_tests` commented out in `pvr_tests.py` - They dont pass because they are using (0,0,0) as time. Need to fix this in future.

`horo_chart` errors fixed somewhat. There can be more errors in this UI. Will fix in future. Till then use the UIs `panchangam` and `horo_chart_tabs` only.

End timings of Nakshathra, Yogam, Karanam using old methods have been fixed. Both old and new methods now should be close to each other. Also fixed Trikaalam, durmurtham timings.

Added more panchanga features: see `jhora.panchanga.drik` for details.

* Several new dhasa have been added. (14 Graha Dhasa, 19 Rasi Dhasa and 3 Annual Dhasa)
* Graha / Nakshatra Dhasas: 
    * vimsottari, ashtottari, yogini, shodasottari, dwadasottari, dwisatpathi, panchottari, satabdika, chaturaaseeti sama, shashtisama, shattrimsa sama, naisargika, tara, karaka

* Annual Dhasas:
    * patyayini, varsha vimsottari, varsha narayana

* Stronger Planet and Rasi are now calculated using planet positions and longitudes (in V2.6.9 or before it was only based on planet houses)

Computation of the five essentials of the panchangam:
* Tithi
* Nakshatra
* Yoga
* Karana
* Vaara

Not just the values, but also the end times of tithis and nakshatras
are computed. The only factor limiting the accuracy of the program
output is the uncertainity in your input values (latitude, longitude).

Also includes computation of sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset.

Also Included :
* Instantaneous planetary positions, including Lagna (Ascendant)
* Navamsa positions
* Choghadiya/Gauri panchanga
* Vimsottari Dasha-Bhukti
* Rahu Kala, Yamaganda Kala, Gulika Kala
* Abhijit muhurta and Durmuhurtams
* Marriage compatibility details (0.9.6)
* Special Lagnas and Upagrahas added to charts (1.0.1)
* Ashtaka Varga charts and Shodhya pinda(0.9.8)
* Print the UI as PDF (using img2pdf and pillow to combine two tabs into one page)

Available in English, Tamil and Telugu, Hindi(0.9.7) and Kannada (0.9.8)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can add your own language by creating `list_values_xx.txt` and `msg_strings_xx.txt`	by copying the _en files and replacing with appropriate native language strings.

Do not forget to add the new language into the `available_languages` in `horo_chart.py` and/or `horo_chart_tabs.py`

NOTE:
All timings are end timings. Timings displayed higher than 24:00 denote
hours past midnight because the Hindu day (tithi) starts and ends with
sunrise. If applicable, daylight savings (DST) are accounted for
automatically based on the date and place entered in the textboxes.


Accuracy
--------

The program is as accurate as the Swiss Ephemeris installed on your system. So generally it is
accurate for years 13000 BCE to 16800 CE. The computational speed stays the same no matter which date you enter. Required swiss ephimeres files are also in /ephe/ folder of this repository.
Overall size of these files is more than 100 MB. To reduce your application size, you can restrict the dates within a range and could remove those ephimeres files from the folder.
